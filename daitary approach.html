            <h2>Caloric Deficit: How It Works</h2>
            <p>A caloric deficit occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body needs, forcing it to use stored fat for energy. This is key to weight loss.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculate your daily calorie needs based on factors like age, gender, weight, activity level, and weight goals.</li>
                <li>Reduce calorie intake by 500-1000 calories per day to achieve a safe and sustainable weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week.</li>
                <li>Monitor food intake using apps or journals to stay within your caloric limit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Balancing Your Diet</h2>
            <p>A balanced diet includes essential nutrients while managing caloric intake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasize whole foods: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.</li>
                <li>Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat snacks.</li>
                <li>Use the plate method or MyPlate guidelines to visualize portion sizes of different food groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="portion-sizes">
            <h2>Portion Sizes for Weight Management</h2>
            <p>Portion control is crucial for managing calories and achieving weight loss:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use measuring cups, spoons, or a food scale to accurately portion foods.</li>
                <li>Follow recommended serving sizes for different food groups: grains, proteins, vegetables, fruits, and fats.</li>
                <li>Learn to estimate portion sizes visually when dining out or preparing meals without measuring tools.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="nutritional-details">
            <h2>Nutritional Details: Calories and Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>Understanding calorie content and macronutrient composition helps make informed food choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn the calorie content of common foods and ingredients using food databases or nutritional labels.</li>
                <li>Understand macronutrient ratios (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) suitable for your weight loss goals.</li>
                <li>Calculate grams of macronutrients based on their calorie content (1 gram of protein or carbohydrate = 4 calories, 1 gram of fat = 9 calories).</li>
            </ul>
